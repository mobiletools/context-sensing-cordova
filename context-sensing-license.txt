Nothing in this document should be interpreted as legal advice.  You are solely responsible to ensure that your use of the Materials (including any Applications and/or Components you develop using the Materials) is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and standards.  Compliance with international privacy standards, laws and regulations can be complicated.  If any applicable law, regulation or standard is more stringent than the requirements and recommendations contained herein, the law/regulation/standard controls.Intel may investigate alleged violations and take all appropriate actions, in its sole discretion, to enforce these terms. Without limiting the foregoing, failure to comply with the requirements constitutes a breach of the Agreement and may lead to termination of the rights and licenses granted herein. If you have any question about applicable laws, regulations or standards, you should seek competent legal counsel.  Ultimately, compliance is your obligation.Privacy RequirementsYou are required to include the following in Applications you create using the Materials: 1)	Notice and Opt-In for End Users.  If your Application collects, uses, or shares any personal information, the end user must be notified:•	what is being collected or used; •	for what specific purpose or purposes the information is being collected; and•	whether the information will be shared with Intel or anyone else.  End Users must affirmatively opt-in to such collection and use prior to Your collection of the information.Definitions of personal information may vary in different countries.  You should use a very broad interpretation of this term to include any information that directly or indirectly relates to an identifiable individual.  Examples can include: Images, voice, location, name, address, birthday, gender, logged activities, survey responses, etc.  Further, most jurisdictions recognize that particular types of personal information are more sensitive than others (e.g. biometrics, children's personal information, financial information, etc.) and, therefore, apply heightened standards to "sensitive personal information."  You must also comply with applicable laws, standards and regulations pertaining to sensitive personal information, if applicable.2)	Use Limitation.  Personal information may only be used for the purpose described in the notice You provided to the end user.  If you wish to use personal information for a different purpose, You must notify the end user and obtain consent prior to any such use. 3)	Data Storage, Transmission and Destruction.  Storage, transmission and destruction of personal information should be performed using industry standard reasonable security measures.  Personal information should be destroyed (or securely discarded) when no longer needed for the purpose for which it was collected.  You must provide each user with a means to request deletion of the information you collect, and you must comply with such request.  If your Application shares any end user information with Intel through the use of the Intel Context APIs, you must inform Your end users that Intel will regularly purge such data so that it retains no more than 6 months of an end user’s data.
